<h1>Reflection</h1>
<h2>Hardest Thing I've Learned</h2>
<p>
The hardest thing I've learned in class so far is the concept of mapping in javascript. All of the work I've done before this class has 
been in java, so my first instincts for transforming data was to use private methods containing for loops. The idea of having 
a function as a parameter was confusing at first, but once I got away from object-oriented principles it clicked. The map function 
handles all of the transformation, so all you have to deal with is writing a function that takes in the current data type and returns 
the data that you're interested in. It's also important to store the resulting array in its own variable, as you cannot assume that the 
original array is passed by reference. That was something that tripped me up. Once you understand those concepts, using the map function 
is actually quite straight-forward.

<h2>Something I Still Don't Understand</h2>
<p>
I feel like I have a solid understanding of the technical skills in that class, but some of the aesthetic factors that go into web design 
are still a bit murky. Of course I have a decent idea of what looks good and I can google color palettes, but I've been wondering about 
some of the finer points of visual design. Things like element ratios, complementary fonts, etc.
